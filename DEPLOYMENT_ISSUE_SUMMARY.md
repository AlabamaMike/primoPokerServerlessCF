# Deployment Issue Summary

## Problem
The multiplayer table creation is still broken because Cloudflare Pages is serving an old deployment.

## What We Fixed
1. ✅ Removed `page.old.tsx` that was causing the issue
2. ✅ Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
3. ✅ CI/CD pipeline ran successfully
4. ✅ Backend WebSocket validation is working (rejecting tableId=lobby)

## Current Status
- The URL `https://6e77d385.primo-poker-frontend.pages.dev` is still serving the OLD code
- This appears to be a deployment preview URL that's not updating
- Create Table button still navigates to `/demo/table/`

## Why This Is Happening
The deployment ID `6e77d385` in the URL suggests this is a specific deployment preview, not the main production URL. Cloudflare Pages creates unique URLs for each deployment.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Find the Correct Production URL
The actual production URL might be different from the preview URL we're testing against.

### Option 2: Check Cloudflare Pages Dashboard
You need to check the Cloudflare Pages dashboard to:
1. See the latest deployment URL
2. Verify if the deployment actually succeeded
3. Check if there's a main production URL different from the preview

### Option 3: Clear Cloudflare Cache
If using a custom domain, you might need to purge the Cloudflare cache.

### Option 4: Wait for Propagation
Sometimes deployments take time to propagate across Cloudflare's edge network.

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. Check the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for the correct production URL
2. Look for the latest deployment and its unique URL
3. Test against the newest deployment URL
4. If using a custom domain, test that as well

The code fix is correct - we just need to ensure we're testing against the right deployment.
