## Refactoring Target

<!-- What code needs to be refactored? -->

**Files/Components:**

- `src/...`

## Current Problems

<!-- What issues exist with the current implementation? -->

- [ ] Code duplication
- [ ] Poor performance
- [ ] Difficult to maintain
- [ ] Violates SOLID principles
- [ ] Inconsistent with project patterns
- [ ] Technical debt
- [ ] Other:

## Desired Outcome

<!-- What should the refactored code achieve? -->

## Constraints

<!-- Any constraints to consider during refactoring -->

- [ ] Must maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Cannot change public API
- [ ] Must preserve existing behavior
- [ ] Performance requirements:
- [ ] Memory constraints:

## Proposed Approach

<!-- Optional: Suggest refactoring strategy -->

## Success Metrics

<!-- How will we measure if the refactoring is successful? -->

- [ ] Code coverage remains >= current level
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Performance improves by X%
- [ ] Reduced lines of code
- [ ] Improved maintainability score

## Risk Assessment

<!-- What could go wrong? -->

- **Low Risk:**
- **Medium Risk:**
- **High Risk:**

## Testing Strategy

<!-- How will we ensure the refactoring doesn't break anything? -->

- Existing tests that must pass:
- New tests to add:
- Manual testing required:

## Priority

- [ ] High - Technical debt causing issues
- [ ] Medium - Would improve development speed
- [ ] Low - Nice to have

## Estimated Impact

- **Development Speed:**
- **Performance:**
- **Maintainability:**
- **Code Quality:**
