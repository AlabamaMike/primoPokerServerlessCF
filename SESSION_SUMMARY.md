# Session Summary - August 3, 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on fixing critical multiplayer cash game functionality and resolving deployment issues that were preventing users from accessing real poker tables.

## Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Multiplayer Navigation Problems ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Users were stuck in demo lobby with no way to access real multiplayer tables
- Demo lobby showed "Disconnected" error
- No "Enter Multiplayer" button visible
- Users couldn't create or join real multiplayer tables

**Solution**: 
- Fixed routing to redirect authenticated users to `/multiplayer` instead of `/lobby`
- Added "Enter Multiplayer" button to lobby sidebar
- Updated login/register pages to redirect to `/multiplayer`

### 2. WebSocket Connection Issues ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Multiplayer page showed WebSocket disconnection errors
- Page required WebSocket connection for basic lobby operations
- Connection failures blocked table creation

**Solution**:
- Created simplified multiplayer page using REST API instead of WebSocket for lobby
- Removed WebSocket dependency for table listing and creation
- WebSocket still used for actual game play, but not lobby operations

### 3. Table Creation API Problems ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Create table API calls were failing
- Incorrect request format sent to backend
- Frontend expected different response field names

**Solution**:
- Fixed API client to send proper TableConfig format with required enums
- Updated response handling to use `response.data.tableId` (not `.id`)
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 4. JWT Token Expiration Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Users getting JWT expiration errors during gameplay
- No automatic token refresh
- Poor error handling for expired tokens

**Solution**:
- Implemented TokenManager with automatic refresh 5 minutes before expiry
- Added refresh token support to auth store
- Updated API client to handle JWT expiration gracefully

### 5. 404 Errors on Game Pages ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Navigating to `/game/{tableId}` returned 404 errors
- Next.js configured for static export, incompatible with dynamic routes
- Build process not handling dynamic table IDs

**Solution**:
- Removed `output: 'export'` from Next.js config to enable dynamic routing
- Configured `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` adapter for proper deployment
- Updated CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy correctly
- Fixed dependency resolution issues

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- User authentication (login/register)
- Navigation from lobby to multiplayer
- Table listing via REST API
- Dynamic routing for game pages (no more 404s)
- CI/CD pipeline building and deploying successfully

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Table creation (works but may still route to demo due to CDN caching)
- Multiplayer page (deployed but cache propagation pending)

### üîß Technical Improvements Made
- Removed all demo/mock data from production flows
- Implemented proper token refresh system
- Fixed build process for Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Improved API client architecture

## Deployment Status
- **Build Pipeline**: ‚úÖ Working (last successful: 16701033956)
- **Frontend**: Deployed to https://6e77d385.primo-poker-frontend.pages.dev
- **Backend**: Deployed to https://primo-poker-server.alabamamike.workers.dev
- **API Health**: ‚úÖ Healthy

## Files Modified Today
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Fixed default routing
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/app/multiplayer/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/app/lobby/page.tsx` - Added navigation button
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` - Fixed redirect
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/app/game/[tableId]/page.tsx` - Fixed dynamic routing
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` - Fixed table creation format
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/stores/auth-store.ts` - Added token refresh
- `/apps/poker-frontend/src/lib/token-manager.ts` - New token management
- `/apps/poker-frontend/next.config.ts` - Removed static export
- `/apps/poker-frontend/package.json` - Updated build scripts
- `/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Fixed deployment process

## Known Issues for Tomorrow

### 1. CDN Cache Propagation
**Issue**: Latest multiplayer page changes may not be fully propagated
**Impact**: Create table might still route to demo
**Solution**: Wait for cache update or investigate cache clearing

### 2. Table Creation Flow
**Issue**: Need to verify end-to-end table creation works in production  
**Next Steps**: Test creating table ‚Üí joining ‚Üí actual gameplay

### 3. Demo Mode Cleanup
**Issue**: Demo table page still exists and is accessible
**Next Steps**: Consider removing `/demo/table` route entirely

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Verify Production Flow**: Test complete user journey from login to gameplay
2. **Game Page Functionality**: Ensure game pages load properly with table data
3. **WebSocket Game Connection**: Test real-time gameplay features
4. **Table Management**: Test joining existing tables, multiple players
5. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful handling of various error conditions
