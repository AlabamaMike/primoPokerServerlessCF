# Production User Testing: Desktop Client Release Plan

**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Ready for Execution
**Approach**: Option A - Fastest Path to User Testing
**Target Version**: v0.1.0 (unsigned build)
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 hours

---

## Executive Summary

This plan enables real user testing by publishing the first production-ready release of the Primo Poker desktop client. The backend is fully operational at `https://primo-poker-server.alabamamike.workers.dev`, but users currently have no access path because:

1. Web frontend was decommissioned (moved to desktop-only architecture)
2. Desktop client code is complete but **no installers have been published**
3. GitHub Actions workflows create draft releases that require manual publishing

**Critical Discovery**: The `.github/workflows/build-desktop-windows.yml` and `.github/workflows/build-desktop-windows-signed.yml` workflows both set `draft: true` (lines 142, 156), meaning releases are created but never automatically published.

**Strategy**: Ship v0.1.0 with known issues documented, using unsigned builds for speed. Fix critical bugs in v0.1.1 after gathering user feedback.

---

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Production Ready Components

1. **Backend Infrastructure** (100% operational)
   - Cloudflare Workers API: https://primo-poker-server.alabamamike.workers.dev
   - 7 Durable Objects: GameTable, Wallet, RNG, Lobby, Chat, RateLimit, Profile
   - Multi-tier storage: D1 (SQL), KV (sessions), R2 (archives)
   - Authentication: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
   - E2E test credentials verified working

2. **Desktop Client Code** (complete but unpublished)
   - Tauri 1.5 application: `apps/poker-desktop/`
   - React frontend with production API configuration
   - Rust backend with secure keyring integration
   - HTTPS/TLS configured for production backend
   - All E2E tests passing: `PRODUCTION-E2E-RESULTS.md`

3. **CI/CD Infrastructure** (operational but requires manual step)
   - GitHub Actions workflows: 3 workflows ready
   - Build artifacts: NSIS installers for Windows
   - Draft release creation: automated
   - **Missing**: Manual publish step to make releases public

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Ship with Documentation)

1. **WebSocket Message Format Inconsistency** (`phase1-issues/01-websocket-standardization.md`)
   - Two competing formats: `payload` vs `data` fields
   - Impact: Client parsing errors, state desynchronization
   - Workaround: Document as "Early Access" limitation
   - Fix in: v0.1.1 (Phase 4)

2. **Button Rotation Logic Fails in 6+ Player Games** (`phase1-issues/02-button-rotation-fix.md`)
   - Button can be assigned to disconnected players
   - Impact: Games become unplayable with 6+ players
   - Workaround: Limit testing to 2-5 player games initially
   - Fix in: v0.1.1 (Phase 4)

### üöß Deferred for Later Releases

1. **Code Signing** - Requires Windows certificate purchase (~$200-400/year)
2. **Auto-Updater** - Currently disabled in `tauri.conf.json:35`
3. **macOS/Linux Builds** - Windows-only for v0.1.0
4. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Basic logging via Cloudflare dashboard
5. **Analytics** - Analytics Engine binding configured but no collection yet

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Release Validation (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Verify the desktop client builds correctly and all critical features work.

### Step 1.1: Run Desktop Test Suite

```bash
cd apps/poker-desktop
npm test
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All E2E tests pass
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- WebSocket connection test succeeds (against production backend)

**Verification**: Check that `PRODUCTION-E2E-RESULTS.md` results are still valid.

---

### Step 1.2: Local Build Test (Windows)

```bash
cd apps/poker-desktop
npm run tauri build
```

**Expected Output**:
- NSIS installer: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Primo Poker_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
- MSI installer: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/Primo Poker_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi`
- Build time: ~5-10 minutes

**Manual Verification Steps**:
1. Install the NSIS installer on a clean Windows machine
2. Launch the application
3. Click "Connect to Server" button
4. Verify connection status changes from "Disconnected" to "Connected"
5. Login with test credentials:
   - Username: `e2e_test_1754187899779`
   - Password: `TestPass123!_1754187899779`
6. Verify chip count displays: 1000 chips
7. Navigate to "Tables" tab - should show empty list (0 tables)
8. Navigate to "Create Table" - verify UI renders correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- Installer runs without errors
- Application launches without crashes
- Backend connection successful
- Authentication flow works
- All UI components render correctly

---

### Step 1.3: Create CHANGELOG for v0.1.0

**File**: `apps/poker-desktop/CHANGELOG.md`

Create if it doesn't exist, or update with v0.1.0 entry:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to the Primo Poker Desktop Client will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-29

### Added
- Initial public release of Primo Poker Desktop Client
- Tauri-based cross-platform desktop application (Windows)
- Connection to production Cloudflare Workers backend

---

### Step 1.4: Verify Version Consistency

Check that all three version files match:

```bash
# Check package.json
grep '"version"' apps/poker-desktop/package.json

# Check Cargo.toml
grep '^version' apps/poker-desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml

# Check tauri.conf.json
grep '"version"' apps/poker-desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
```

**Expected Output**: All should show `0.1.0`

**If versions don't match**, update manually or run:

```bash
# Update all three files to 0.1.0
cd apps/poker-desktop
npm version 0.1.0 --no-git-tag-version

# Then manually update Cargo.toml line 3 and tauri.conf.json line 10
```

**Success Criteria**:
- `package.json:3` ‚Üí `"version": "0.1.0"`
- `Cargo.toml:3` ‚Üí `version = "0.1.0"`
- `tauri.conf.json:10` ‚Üí `"version": "0.1.0"`

---

## Phase 2: Build and Publish First Release (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow and publish the draft release.

### Step 2.1: Push to Main Branch

If all Phase 1 validations pass, commit any changes:

```bash
cd /home/goose/dev/primoPokerServerlessCF

# Stage changes (CHANGELOG, version files if updated)
git add apps/poker-desktop/CHANGELOG.md
git add apps/poker-desktop/package.json
git add apps/poker-desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
git add apps/poker-desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json

# Commit
git commit -m "chore(desktop): prepare v0.1.0 release

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to main (triggers GitHub Actions)
git push origin main
```

**What Happens Next**:
1. `.github/workflows/build-desktop-windows.yml` triggers automatically
2. Workflow runs for ~10-15 minutes:
   - Installs Rust toolchain
   - Runs `npm install`
   - Executes `npm run tauri build`
   - Creates NSIS installer artifact
   - Creates **DRAFT** release with tag `desktop-v0.1.0`
3. Release remains unpublished until manual action

**Monitor Progress**:
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/AlabamaMike/primoPokerServerlessCF/actions
- Look for workflow run triggered by your push
- Check for green checkmark (success) or red X (failure)

---

### Step 2.2: Publish the Draft Release

## Tips for New Players

### Starting Out

- **Start with low stakes**: 10/20 or 25/50 tables
- **Limit to 2-5 players**: Avoids known button rotation bug in v0.1.0
- **Watch a hand**: Observe gameplay before jumping in
- **Use test account**: Practice with test credentials before playing for real

### Common Mistakes

- **Betting too much pre-flop**: Preserve chips for later streets
- **Chasing bad hands**: Fold weak hands early to save chips
- **Ignoring position**: Later positions have more information
- **Playing too many hands**: Be selective with starting hands

### Bankroll Management

- **Never risk more than 5%** of total chips on single hand
- **Leave table if down 50%** of buy-in to preserve bankroll
- **Move up stakes slowly**: Master lower stakes first

---

## Known Limitations (v0.1.0)

### Player Count

- **Recommended**: 2-5 players per table
- **Issue**: Button rotation may fail in 6+ player games
- **Workaround**: Avoid full 9-player tables until v0.1.1

### Message Parsing

- **Issue**: Occasional WebSocket parsing errors
- **Symptom**: Game state appears frozen or incorrect
- **Workaround**: Leave table and rejoin to refresh state

### Platform Support

- **Windows Only**: macOS and Linux builds coming in future releases

## Phase 4: Optional Post-Testing Improvements (Deferred to v0.1.1)

**Goal**: Fix critical bugs identified in Phase 1 after gathering user feedback.

**Status**: Deferred until after v0.1.0 user testing completes.

### Issues to Address in v0.1.1

#### 1. WebSocket Message Format Standardization

**Issue**: `phase1-issues/01-websocket-standardization.md`

**Files to Fix**:
- `packages/api/src/websocket.ts` - Standardize on `payload` field
- `packages/persistence/src/durable-objects/game-table-do.ts` - Update message format
- `packages/api/src/websocket-manager.ts` - Ensure consistent formatting

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface StandardWebSocketMessage {
  id: string;              // Unique message ID (UUID)
  version: number;         // Protocol version (start with 1)
  type: string;            // Message type (e.g., 'game_update')
  payload: any;            // Message data (ALWAYS use 'payload', never 'data')
  timestamp: number;       // Unix timestamp in milliseconds
  sequenceId: number;      // For message ordering
  requiresAck?: boolean;   // Optional acknowledgment requirement
  correlationId?: string;  // For request/response pairing
}
```

**Migration Strategy**:
1. Implement new format with version 1
2. Maintain backward compatibility for old clients (check version field)
3. Deprecate old format in v0.2.0

**Testing**:
- Update WebSocket tests in `tests/e2e/multiplayer/simple-game.spec.ts`
- Add message format validation tests
- Test with 3+ players to ensure synchronization

#### 2. Button Rotation Logic Fix

**Issue**: `phase1-issues/02-button-rotation-fix.md`

**File to Fix**: `packages/persistence/src/durable-objects/game-table-do.ts`

**Current Flawed Logic**:
```typescript
private findNextDealerIndex(players: GameTablePlayer[]): number {
  // Missing validation for player status
  // No handling of disconnected players
}
```

**Proposed Solution**:
```typescript
private findNextDealerIndex(players: GameTablePlayer[]): number {
  // Filter for active, connected players only
  const activePlayers = players
    .map((p, i) => ({ player: p, index: i }))
    .filter(({ player }) =>
      player.status === PlayerStatus.ACTIVE &&
      !player.isDisconnected
    );

  // Validate minimum player count
  if (activePlayers.length < 2) {
    throw new InsufficientPlayersError('Minimum 2 active players required for button rotation');
  }

  // Find current button holder
  const currentButtonPlayer = activePlayers.find(
    ({ player }) => player.position?.seat === this.state.buttonPosition
  );

  // If current button holder not found, start with first active player
  if (!currentButtonPlayer) {
    return activePlayers[0].index;
  }

  // Rotate clockwise to next active player
  const currentIndex = activePlayers.indexOf(currentButtonPlayer);
  return activePlayers[(currentIndex + 1) % activePlayers.length].index;
}
```

**Testing**:
- Add test case: `button-rotation-with-disconnections.spec.ts`
- Simulate player disconnections mid-game
- Verify button skips disconnected players
- Test with 6-9 player games

#### 3. Code Signing (Optional)

**Cost**: $200-400/year for Windows code signing certificate

**Benefits**:
- No Windows SmartScreen warnings
- Professional appearance
- Increased user trust

**Providers**:
- DigiCert: ~$400/year (EV code signing)
- Sectigo: ~$200/year (standard code signing)
- Certum: ~$200/year (standard code signing)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Purchase certificate from provider
2. Export as `.pfx` file
3. Add certificate to GitHub Secrets:
   - `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` (base64-encoded .pfx)
   - `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` (pfx password)
4. Trigger `.github/workflows/build-desktop-windows-signed.yml`

**Workflow Updates** (already configured):
- Workflow decodes certificate: lines 73-112
- Signs installer during build
- Uploads signed installer to S3 for auto-updater: lines 172-190

---

#### 4. Auto-Updater Setup (Optional)

**Current State**: Disabled in `tauri.conf.json:35`

**Requirements**:
- S3 bucket for hosting update manifests (configured in signed workflow)
- Code signing certificate (required for Windows updates)
- Update manifest generation

**Configuration** (`tauri.conf.json`):
```json
{
  "updater": {
    "active": true,  // Currently false
    "endpoints": [
      "https://primo-poker-updates.s3.amazonaws.com/latest.json"
    ],
    "dialog": true,
    "pubkey": "dW50cnVzdGVkIGNvbW1lbnQ6IG1pbmlzaWduIHB1YmxpYyBrZXkgOTY5QjUyRjUyRTQ1MkNDQQpSV1JUQjQ5TUJFTHlBeEFSQ2ZRUCtJTVFVZkZRbzVEUk5uRlJtUlo4a1pBYkhNeEpJdU9qc1JvCg=="
  }
}
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Purchase code signing certificate (required for Windows updates)
2. Enable updater: set `active: true`
3. Generate signing key pair: `tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/myapp.key`
4. Update `pubkey` in tauri.conf.json
5. Build with signed workflow (automatically uploads to S3)
6. Application checks for updates on launch

**Testing**:
1. Publish v0.1.1 with updater enabled
2. Install v0.1.0 on test machine
3. Launch app - should prompt for update
4. Accept update - should download and install v0.1.1

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: GitHub Actions Build Failure

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (blocks release)

**Mitigation**:
- Phase 1 includes local build test to catch issues early
- Workflow has run successfully before (per research)
- Fallback: Manual build and release upload if workflow fails

**Contingency**:
```bash
# Manual build and upload
cd apps/poker-desktop
npm run tauri build

# Upload to GitHub manually
gh release create desktop-v0.1.0 \
  "src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Primo Poker_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe" \
  --title "Desktop v0.1.0" \
  --notes-file .github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md
```

---

### Risk 2: Windows SmartScreen Blocks Users

**Likelihood**: High (expected for unsigned builds)
**Impact**: Medium (users can bypass, but may be confused)

**Mitigation**:
- INSTALLATION.md includes detailed SmartScreen bypass instructions
- Quick Start guide mentions this explicitly
- Release notes include warning and instructions
- GitHub README includes warning

**Long-term Solution**:
- Purchase code signing certificate for v0.1.1 or v0.2.0
- Estimated cost: $200-400/year

---

### Risk 3: Critical Bug Discovered During Testing

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (may require emergency patch)

**Mitigation**:
- Known issues already documented (WebSocket, button rotation)
- Users warned to limit games to 2-5 players
- Marked as "Early Access" release
- Issue tracker ready for bug reports

**Contingency**:
- Hot-fix workflow ready: `.github/workflows/build-desktop-windows.yml`
- Can publish v0.1.1 within 1-2 hours if critical bug found
- Backend fixes can be deployed instantly (Cloudflare Workers)

---

### Risk 4: Backend API Outage During Testing

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High (users cannot play)

**Mitigation**:
- Backend has run stably for weeks (per E2E test results)
- Cloudflare Workers infrastructure highly reliable (99.99% uptime SLA)
- Health endpoint available for status checks

**Contingency**:
- Monitor backend health: https://primo-poker-server.alabamamike.workers.dev/api/health

## Conclusion

This plan provides a **fast path to user testing** by publishing the first public release of the Primo Poker desktop client (v0.1.0). The backend is production-ready, the desktop client code is complete and tested, and the CI/CD infrastructure is operational.

**Critical Finding**: GitHub Actions creates draft releases that require manual publishing - this is the missing step blocking user access.

**Key Decision**: Ship v0.1.0 with known issues documented, using unsigned builds for speed. Fix critical bugs in v0.1.1 after gathering user feedback.

**Timeline**: 3-4 hours to first release, with comprehensive user documentation.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 pre-release validation to verify readiness for public release.

---

**Plan Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Execution
**Estimated Completion**: 2025-09-29 (same day)
**Target Version**: v0.1.0 (Early Access, unsigned)
**Follow-up Version**: v0.1.1 (bug fixes)

---

**Questions or concerns?** Review this plan thoroughly before beginning Phase 1. All steps are designed to be reversible (drafts, documentation commits) until the final "Publish Release" button click.
