# Multiplayer Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the multiplayer poker system, detailing completed phases and remaining work.

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Automatic Spectator Mode (Completed)
- Players automatically join as spectators when entering a table
- Real-time spectator count tracking and display
- WebSocket message handlers for spectator events
- Smooth transition from spectator to player

### ✅ Phase 2: Enhanced Seat Selection (Completed)
- Visual seat selection with hover effects
- Seat reservation system with 60-second timeout
- Tooltips showing seat availability and player info
- Click-to-sit functionality from spectator mode
- Backend validation and reservation management

### ✅ Phase 3: Stand Up Functionality (Completed)
- Stand up button in player controls
- Confirmation modal with chip count display
- Active hand protection (cannot stand up during hand)
- Automatic chip return to bankroll
- Smooth transition back to spectator mode
- Real-time updates for all connected users

### ✅ Phase 4: Wallet Integration (Completed)
- Persistent bankroll system with localStorage
- Transaction history tracking (deposits, withdrawals, buy-ins, cash-outs)
- WalletDisplay component in game header
- Expandable transaction history with timestamps
- DepositModal for adding chips (demo/play money)
- Automatic transaction recording for game events
- Visual indicators for transaction types

## Current Architecture

### Frontend State Management
- **Auth Store**: User authentication and token management
- **Game Store**: Game state, players, and actions
- **Bankroll Store**: Wallet balance and transaction history

### WebSocket Communication
- Singleton pattern for connection management
- Event-based message handling
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Real-time state synchronization

### Backend Services
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Main HTTP/WebSocket gateway
- **Durable Objects**: 
  - GameTable DO: Table state and game logic
  - SecureRNG DO: Cryptographically secure shuffling
  - TableRegistry DO: Active table management

## Remaining Phases

### Phase 5: WebSocket State Transitions (3-4 days)
- [ ] Implement proper state machine for game phases
- [ ] Add transition animations
- [ ] Handle edge cases and disconnections
- [ ] Implement automatic action timeouts
- [ ] Add connection state indicators

### Phase 6: E2E Testing (2-3 days)
- [ ] Complete multiplayer test scenarios
- [ ] Test all user journeys end-to-end
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple players
- [ ] Error handling and recovery testing
- [ ] Production smoke tests

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Automatic token refresh
   - WebSocket authentication via headers

2. **Table Management**
   - Create/join table flow
   - Spectator-first approach
   - Seat selection and reservation
   - Stand up/sit down functionality

3. **Game State Synchronization**
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Conflict resolution

4. **Bankroll System**
   - Persistent balance storage
   - Transaction history
   - Buy-in/cash-out tracking
   - Visual wallet display

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Warnings**: ~199 linting warnings (mostly any types)
2. **Missing UI Components**: Some imports for UI components that don't exist
3. **Test Coverage**: Limited test coverage for new features
4. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases need better error handling

## Production Readiness

### Completed
- ✅ Basic multiplayer functionality
- ✅ WebSocket connection management
- ✅ Player state synchronization
- ✅ Spectator mode
- ✅ Seat selection
- ✅ Bankroll management
- ✅ Stand up/sit down flow

### Still Needed
- ⏳ Comprehensive error handling
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Full test coverage
- ⏳ Production monitoring
- ⏳ Rate limiting
- ⏳ Anti-cheat measures

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 5: WebSocket State Transitions
2. Address TypeScript warnings
3. Improve error handling
4. Add comprehensive logging
5. Complete E2E test suite

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 5: 3-4 days
- Phase 6: 2-3 days
- Production hardening: 3-5 days
- **Total to production-ready**: ~8-12 days
