## Key Security Features Tested

### 1. Cryptographic Shuffle
- Verifies true randomness using crypto.getRandomValues()
- Tests bias elimination through rejection sampling
- Validates shuffle proofs for tamper detection
- Ensures no cards are lost or duplicated

### 2. Authentication & JWT
- Tests token generation with proper expiration
- Validates token verification and rejection of invalid tokens
- Tests session management and revocation
- Verifies rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

### 3. Financial Integrity
- Tests atomic wallet operations
- Validates fund freezing during active games
- Ensures accurate transaction history
- Tests concurrent operation safety

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:ci

# Run individual package tests
npm test -w @primo-poker/security
npm test -w @primo-poker/persistence

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage -w @primo-poker/security
npm test -- --coverage -w @primo-poker/persistence
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on every push
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Set up coverage reporting to track metrics
3. **Integration Tests**: Add tests for component interactions
4. **Performance Tests**: Add benchmarks for shuffle and crypto operations

## Test Maintenance

- Tests use mocked dependencies to avoid external package issues
- Timing delays ensure proper transaction ordering
- All critical paths have comprehensive test coverage
