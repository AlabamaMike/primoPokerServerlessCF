# Phase 1 Critical Issues

This directory contains issue templates for critical problems identified during the Phase 1 architecture review that need to be addressed for platform stability.

## Critical Issues

1. **[01-websocket-standardization.md](./01-websocket-standardization.md)** - WebSocket Message Format Inconsistency
   - Priority: Critical
   - Type: Bug
   - Impact: Causing client-side parsing errors and state desynchronization

2. **[02-button-rotation-fix.md](./02-button-rotation-fix.md)** - Button Rotation Logic Fails in 6+ Player Games
   - Priority: Critical
   - Type: Bug
   - Impact: Games become unplayable when button lands on disconnected player

3. **[03-state-synchronization.md](./03-state-synchronization.md)** - Implement State Synchronization Layer
   - Priority: High
   - Type: Enhancement
   - Impact: Essential for reliable multiplayer experience

4. **[04-error-recovery-framework.md](./04-error-recovery-framework.md)** - Comprehensive Error Recovery Framework
   - Priority: High
   - Type: Enhancement
   - Impact: Required to achieve 99.9% uptime target

## How to Create Issues

Use GitHub CLI to create these issues:
