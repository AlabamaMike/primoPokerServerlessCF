### 1. **Modern React Architecture**
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, professional styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth card animations and UI transitions

### 2. **Core Infrastructure**
- **API Client** with JWT authentication and token management
- **WebSocket Client** for real-time game communication
- **Authentication Store** using Zustand for state management
- **Type-safe** integration with backend APIs

### 3. **UI Component Library**
- **Poker Cards** with realistic flip animations and suit rendering
- **Button System** with poker-specific variants (fold, call, raise)
- **Layout System** with professional poker table theming
- **Responsive Design** optimized for desktop and mobile

### 4. **Application Pages**
- **Landing Page** showcasing platform capabilities with demo cards
- **Authentication Flow** (login/register) with proper error handling
- **User Lobby** with stats dashboard and table selection
- **Protected Routes** with authentication guards

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
