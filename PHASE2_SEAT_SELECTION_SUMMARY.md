# Phase 2: Seat Selection Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Enhanced PlayerSeat Component
**File**: `apps/poker-frontend/src/components/poker/PlayerSeat.tsx`

- Added hover tooltip showing seat info (position name, buy-in range)
- Enhanced empty seat visualization with three states:
  - Available (green, clickable)
  - Reserved by others (orange, disabled)
  - Reserved by you (blue, shows "Complete buy-in")
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Position names (BTN, SB, BB, UTG, etc.)

### 2. Seat Reservation Backend
**File**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Added `SeatReservation` interface with player info and expiration
- Added `seatReservations` Map to GameTableState
- Implemented `handleReserveSeat` WebSocket handler:
  - Validates seat availability
  - Creates 60-second reservation
  - Broadcasts updates to all connected users
  - Auto-expires reservations after timeout
- Updated `handleJoinTable` to:
  - Accept specific seat requests
  - Clear reservations when player joins
  - Remove player from spectators on join

### 3. Table Configuration Pass-through
**Files**: 
- `apps/poker-frontend/src/components/poker/PokerTable.tsx`
- `apps/poker-frontend/src/app/game/[tableId]/client-page.tsx`

- Added minBuyIn/maxBuyIn props to PokerTable
- Pass table config from client page to PokerTable
- PokerTable passes buy-in limits to each PlayerSeat

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- Seat tooltips show:
  - Seat number
  - Position name (BTN, SB, BB, etc.)
  - Buy-in range in green
- Reserved seats show clear status
- Hover effects only on available seats

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Smart Seat Selection**: 
   - Hover to preview seat info
   - Click to reserve and open buy-in modal
   - Visual feedback for all states

2. **Seat Reservation System**:
   - 60-second reservations
   - Prevents race conditions
   - Auto-cleanup on expiration
   - One reservation per player

3. **Seamless Transitions**:
   - Spectator → Reserved Seat → Seated Player
   - Clear visual indicators at each step
   - Automatic spectator removal on join

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Reservation Timeout**: 60 seconds gives players enough time to complete buy-in
2. **Single Reservation**: Players can only reserve one seat at a time
3. **Auto-cleanup**: Reservations expire automatically without manual intervention
4. **Spectator Integration**: Joining a table automatically removes spectator status

## Next Steps

1. Add WebSocket handlers in frontend for seat reservation events
2. Update seat click handler to reserve seat before showing modal
3. Handle reservation expiration in UI
4. Add countdown timer for active reservations
5. Test concurrent seat selection scenarios
