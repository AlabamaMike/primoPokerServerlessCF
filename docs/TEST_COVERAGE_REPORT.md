# Unit Test Coverage Report

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive unit test suite created to address critical security and financial risks in the poker application.

## Test Files Created

### 1. Security Tests

#### `/packages/security/src/__tests__/secure-shuffle.test.ts`
**Coverage Areas:**
- **Basic Shuffle Operations**: Array integrity, element preservation, edge cases
- **Randomness & Distribution**: Statistical uniformity over multiple shuffles
- **Bias Elimination**: Rejection sampling verification, entropy usage analysis
- **Shuffle Proof & Verification**: Cryptographic proof generation and validation
- **Card Deck Specific**: 52-card deck shuffling, suit/rank integrity
- **Security Edge Cases**: Concurrent shuffles, repeated elements, large arrays

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Verifies shuffle produces different results each time
- ✅ Ensures uniform distribution (chi-square analysis)
- ✅ Validates cryptographic proofs can detect tampering
- ✅ Tests bias elimination for prime-sized arrays
- ✅ Verifies no cards are lost or duplicated during shuffle

#### `/packages/security/src/__tests__/authentication.test.ts`
**Coverage Areas:**
- **JWT Token Management**: Generation, verification, expiration
- **Authentication Flow**: Login with username/email, password validation
- **Session Management**: Active session tracking, revocation
- **Token Refresh**: Maintaining sessions, token rotation
- **Password Security**: Hashing, salt generation, verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Attempt tracking, time windows, cleanup
- **MFA Support**: Backup code generation and validation

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Validates JWT tokens with correct signatures
- ✅ Rejects expired or tampered tokens
- ✅ Enforces rate limiting on login attempts
- ✅ Supports session revocation (logout)
- ✅ Handles unicode and special characters in passwords
- ✅ Prevents backup code reuse

### 2. Financial Tests

#### `/packages/persistence/src/__tests__/wallet-manager.test.ts`
**Coverage Areas:**
- **Wallet Initialization**: Default/custom balances, auto-creation
- **Buy-In Operations**: Validation, fund freezing, insufficient funds
- **Cash-Out Operations**: Profit/loss handling, fund unfreezing
- **Transaction Recording**: Win/loss tracking, transaction history
- **Balance Management**: Available balance calculation, frozen funds
- **Concurrency Safety**: Simultaneous operations, data integrity
- **Edge Cases**: Negative balances, large transactions, rapid operations

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Prevents buy-in with insufficient funds
- ✅ Correctly freezes/unfreezes funds during play
- ✅ Maintains accurate transaction history
- ✅ Handles concurrent buy-ins safely
- ✅ Supports high-stakes transactions
- ✅ Prevents transaction history bloat (>1000 records)

## Running the Tests

### Individual Package Tests
```bash
# Security package tests
npm test -w @primo-poker/security

# Persistence package tests  
npm test -w @primo-poker/persistence

# With coverage
npm test -- --coverage -w @primo-poker/security
```

### All Tests with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:ci
```

## Coverage Targets
All critical components now have coverage targets of:
- **Branches**: 80%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%
- **Statements**: 80%

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. **Deck Shuffling Security**
- **Risk**: Predictable or biased shuffles could enable cheating
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive tests verify cryptographic randomness, bias elimination, and tamper detection

### 2. **Authentication & Session Security**
- **Risk**: Token forgery, session hijacking, brute force attacks
- **Mitigation**: Tests verify JWT security, session lifecycle, and rate limiting

### 3. **Financial Integrity**
- **Risk**: Double spending, negative balances, lost funds
- **Mitigation**: Tests ensure atomic operations, proper fund freezing, and transaction accuracy

### 4. **Concurrency Issues**
- **Risk**: Race conditions during simultaneous operations
- **Mitigation**: Tests verify concurrent buy-ins and rapid transactions maintain consistency

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Tests**: Create tests for component interactions
2. **Load Testing**: Verify system behavior under high load
3. **Security Audit**: External review of cryptographic implementations
4. **Monitoring**: Add runtime checks for test scenarios in production

## Test Maintenance
- Run tests before every deployment
- Update tests when adding new features
- Monitor test coverage metrics
- Review failed tests immediately
