## Recent Progress (Phase 3B - August 1, 2025)

### 🎯 **Major Achievement: Connection Error Resolution**
**Problem**: Frontend showing persistent "Connection Error: Connection failed" messages
**Root Cause**: Frontend making relative API calls (`/api/health`) instead of calling backend Workers
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive API configuration system

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
1. **Created Configuration System** (`apps/poker-frontend/src/lib/config.ts`):
   - `getApiUrl()` and `getWebSocketUrl()` functions
   - Environment variable detection with fallback mechanisms
   - Works in both build-time and runtime contexts

2. **Updated All API Call Locations**:
   - `apps/poker-frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` - Main API client
   - `apps/poker-frontend/src/app/lobby/enhanced-page.tsx` - Lobby API calls
   - `apps/poker-frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - WebSocket connections

3. **E2E Testing Framework** (Playwright):
   - Comprehensive API connectivity validation
   - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Real-time connection diagnostics and error monitoring

### 📊 **Test Results & Validation**
- **Before Fix**: All API calls returned 404 errors
- **After Fix**: 
  - ✅ **0 console errors**
  - ✅ **0 network errors** 
  - ✅ **0 connection error messages**
  - ✅ Health endpoint: `200 OK` with proper JSON response
  - ✅ Tables endpoint: `200 OK` with empty array (expected)
  - ✅ CORS properly configured with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

### 🚀 **Deployment Status**
- **Frontend**: https://21613f51.primo-poker-frontend.pages.dev (✅ Working)
- **Backend**: https://primo-poker-server.alabamamike.workers.dev (✅ Working)
- **Integration**: Frontend-backend communication fully functional (✅ Verified)
