## Tips for New Players

### Starting Out

- **Start with low stakes**: 10/20 or 25/50 tables
- **Limit to 2-5 players**: Avoids known button rotation bug in v0.1.0
- **Watch a hand**: Observe gameplay before jumping in
- **Use test account**: Practice with test credentials before playing for real

### Common Mistakes

- **Betting too much pre-flop**: Preserve chips for later streets
- **Chasing bad hands**: Fold weak hands early to save chips
- **Ignoring position**: Later positions have more information
- **Playing too many hands**: Be selective with starting hands

### Bankroll Management

- **Never risk more than 5%** of total chips on single hand
- **Leave table if down 50%** of buy-in to preserve bankroll
- **Move up stakes slowly**: Master lower stakes first

---

## Known Limitations (v0.1.0)

### Player Count

- **Recommended**: 2-5 players per table
- **Issue**: Button rotation may fail in 6+ player games
- **Workaround**: Avoid full 9-player tables until v0.1.1

### Message Parsing

- **Issue**: Occasional WebSocket parsing errors
- **Symptom**: Game state appears frozen or incorrect
- **Workaround**: Leave table and rejoin to refresh state

### Platform Support

- **Windows Only**: macOS and Linux builds coming in future releases
