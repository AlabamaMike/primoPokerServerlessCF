# Phase 3: Stand Up Functionality Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Backend Stand Up Handler
**File**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Added `handleStandUp` WebSocket handler
- Validates player is at table and not in active hand
- Helper method `isPlayerInActiveHand` checks game state
- Removes player from table and adds back as spectator
- Broadcasts updates to all connected users
- Returns chip count for bankroll update

### 2. Stand Up Modal Component
**File**: `apps/poker-frontend/src/components/StandUpModal.tsx`

- Confirmation dialog with chip count display
- Shows chips being returned to bankroll
- Warning about not being able to stand up during active hand
- Loading state during stand up process
- Clean, consistent UI design

### 3. Bankroll Store
**File**: `apps/poker-frontend/src/stores/bankroll-store.ts`

- Persisted Zustand store for player's bankroll
- Tracks balance with add/remove chip methods
- LocalStorage persistence
- Default starting balance of $10,000
- Timestamp tracking for updates

### 4. Frontend Integration
**Files**: 
- `apps/poker-frontend/src/app/game/[tableId]/client-page.tsx`
- `apps/poker-frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`

- Stand Up button in player controls (disabled during turn)
- Modal confirmation flow
- WebSocket `stand_up` message handler
- Automatic bankroll update on success
- Smooth transition to spectator mode
- Bankroll integration with buy-in flow

### 5. WebSocket Events
- `stand_up`: Request to stand up with playerId
- `stand_up_success`: Confirmation with chip count
- `player_stood_up`: Broadcast to all users
- Automatic spectator count update

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Active Hand Protection**: Cannot stand up during active hand
2. **Chip Management**: Chips automatically returned to bankroll
3. **State Transitions**: Player → Spectator with proper cleanup
4. **Real-time Updates**: All users see when someone stands up
5. **Persistence**: Bankroll balance persists across sessions

## User Flow

1. Player clicks "Stand Up" button
2. Confirmation modal shows chip count
3. On confirm, WebSocket sends stand up request
4. Backend validates and processes
5. Chips returned to bankroll
6. Player becomes spectator
7. Seat becomes available
8. All users see update
