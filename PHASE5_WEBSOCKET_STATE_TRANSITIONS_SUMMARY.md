# Phase 5: WebSocket State Transitions Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Seat Availability Updates
**Backend**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Added real-time seat availability broadcasts when:
  - Player joins a table (seat becomes unavailable)
  - Player stands up (seat becomes available)
  - Seat is reserved or reservation expires
- New message types:
  - `seat_availability_update`: Single seat status change
  - `seat_availability_bulk`: All seats status (sent on spectator join)
- Added `broadcastSeatAvailability()` method to send complete seat status

### 2. Wallet Balance Change Messages
**Backend**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Added wallet balance update messages when:
  - Player buys in at table (deducts from wallet)
  - Player stands up/cashes out (returns to wallet)
- Message format:
  ```typescript
  {
    type: 'wallet_balance_update',
    data: {
      playerId: string,
      changeAmount: number, // positive for cash out, negative for buy in
      changeType: 'buy_in' | 'cash_out',
      tableId: string,
      description: string
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Player State Transition Messages
**Backend**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Added `broadcastPlayerStateTransition()` method
- Broadcasts state changes:
  - spectator → player (when joining table)
  - player → spectator (when standing up)
  - player → disconnected (on disconnect)
  - disconnected → player (on reconnect)
- Message format:
  ```typescript
  {
    type: 'player_state_transition',
    data: {
      playerId: string,
      transition: {
        from: 'spectator' | 'player' | 'disconnected',
        to: 'spectator' | 'player' | 'disconnected',
        reason?: string,
        details?: any
      },
      timestamp: number
    }
  }
  ```

### 4. Table State Synchronization
**Backend**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Added `handleStateSync()` method for full state requests
- Handles `request_state_sync` message type
- Returns complete table state including:
  - Current game state
  - Player/spectator status
  - Seat availability
  - Hole cards (if player is active)
- Automatically called on reconnection

### 5. Disconnection/Reconnection Handling
**Backend**: `packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`

- Enhanced `webSocketClose` handler:
  - Marks disconnected players with DISCONNECTED status
  - Gives 30 seconds for reconnection before removal
  - Broadcasts state transitions
- Enhanced `webSocketMessage` handler:
  - Detects reconnecting players
  - Restores connection and updates status
  - Automatically syncs state on reconnect

### 6. Frontend Integration
**Frontend**: `apps/poker-frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`

- Added handlers for all new message types:
  - `seat_availability_update`: Updates single seat
  - `seat_availability_bulk`: Updates all seats
  - `wallet_balance_update`: Logs balance changes
  - `player_state_transition`: Logs state changes
  - `state_sync_response`: Updates complete table state
- Added `requestStateSync()` method for manual sync

**Frontend**: `apps/poker-frontend/src/stores/game-store.ts`

- Added `SeatInfo` interface for seat tracking
- Added `seatAvailability` array to game state
- Added methods:
  - `setSeatAvailability()`: Update all seats
  - `updateSeatAvailability()`: Update single seat

## WebSocket Message Flow

### Join Table Flow
1. Client: `join_table` → Server
2. Server: `join_table_success` → Client
3. Server: `wallet_balance_update` (buy-in) → Client
4. Server: `seat_availability_update` → All clients
5. Server: `player_state_transition` (spectator→player) → All clients

### Stand Up Flow
1. Client: `stand_up` → Server
2. Server: `stand_up_success` → Client
3. Server: `wallet_balance_update` (cash out) → Client
4. Server: `seat_availability_update` → All clients
5. Server: `player_state_transition` (player→spectator) → All clients

### Disconnection Flow
1. WebSocket closes
2. Server marks player as DISCONNECTED
3. Server: `player_state_transition` (player→disconnected) → All clients
4. 30-second timer starts
5. If no reconnect: Remove player and broadcast final transition

### Reconnection Flow
1. Client reconnects with same playerId
2. Server detects existing connection
3. Server restores connection and status
4. Server: `player_state_transition` (disconnected→player) → All clients
5. Server: `state_sync_response` → Reconnecting client

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Seat availability updates on join/leave
- [x] Wallet balance messages on buy-in/cash-out
- [x] Player state transitions broadcast correctly
- [x] State sync returns complete table state
- [x] Disconnection grace period works
- [x] Reconnection restores player state
- [x] Frontend receives and processes all messages

## Next Steps

With Phase 5 complete, all core WebSocket state transitions are implemented:
- ✅ Automatic spectator mode (Phase 1)
- ✅ Enhanced seat selection (Phase 2)
- ✅ Stand up functionality (Phase 3)
- ✅ Wallet Integration (Phase 4)
- ✅ WebSocket State Transitions (Phase 5)

Remaining work:
- Phase 6: E2E Testing - Comprehensive test coverage for the complete user journey

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: All clients stay synchronized with seat availability
2. **Graceful Disconnections**: Players have 30 seconds to reconnect
3. **State Recovery**: Full state sync on reconnection
4. **Transaction Tracking**: Wallet changes are broadcast for UI updates
5. **Player Awareness**: Everyone sees player state transitions in real-time
