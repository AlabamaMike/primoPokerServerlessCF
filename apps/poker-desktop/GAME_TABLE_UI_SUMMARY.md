## 🎮 Key Features Implemented

### Visual Design
- **Green felt table** with realistic poker table appearance

### Data Structures
- Full TypeScript interfaces matching backend API
- Proper game state management

## 🧪 Testing

### Component Tests
- **UI-only tests**: 3/3 passing for Card component rendering
- **Isolated testing**: Components tested in standalone HTML pages
- **Visual verification**: Screenshots and video recordings available

### Integration Tests
- Full game flow tests created (authentication still needs connection fixes)
- Demo functionality tests
- Navigation and state management tests

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Integration
- Fully typed components with proper interfaces
- Game state types matching backend schema
- Player action types and handlers

### React Patterns
- Functional components with hooks
- State management with useState and useEffect
- Event handling and prop drilling
- Conditional rendering for game states

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Dynamic class names based on game state
- Hover effects and transitions
- Mobile-friendly layout considerations

## 🎯 Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED**: Game table UI is fully functional with:
- All visual components working
- Mock data integration
- Interactive demo mode
- Proper game state visualization
- Professional poker table appearance

**🔄 NEXT STEPS**: WebSocket integration for real-time gameplay

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the desktop app**: `cd apps/poker-desktop && npm run tauri dev`
2. **Login with any credentials** (uses mock authentication)
3. **Click "Table Demo"** to see the game table in action
4. **Use demo controls** to test different game states:
   - Switch player views
   - Auto-progress through phases
   - Reset hands
   - View player information
