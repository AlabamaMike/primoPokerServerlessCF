# Wallet Security Improvements - Deferred Work

This document outlines future improvements for the wallet security implementation that were identified during the initial implementation but deferred to keep the scope manageable.

## Performance Enhancements

### 1. Persistent Security State
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: High
**Description**: Currently, security state (rate limits, nonces, fraud detection data) is stored only in memory and resets when the Durable Object restarts. Consider persisting critical security state to Durable Object storage.

**Considerations**:
- Complex migration logic required
- Must handle edge cases (corrupted state, version mismatches)
- Balance between security and performance
- May introduce new attack vectors if not implemented carefully

### 2. Distributed Rate Limiting
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: High
**Description**: Implement distributed rate limiting for multi-instance scenarios using KV store or similar.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent rate limiting across all instances
- Better protection against distributed attacks
- More accurate global limits

## Security Enhancements

### 3. Machine Learning Fraud Detection
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Very High
**Description**: Implement ML-based fraud detection to identify complex patterns that rule-based systems miss.

**Features**:
- Anomaly detection for player behavior
- Transaction pattern analysis
- Real-time risk scoring
- Adaptive learning from historical data

### 4. Geographic Velocity Checking
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Description**: Improve geographic anomaly detection with more sophisticated velocity checking.

**Features**:
- Calculate realistic travel times between locations
- Consider time zones and flight patterns
- Account for VPN usage patterns
- Regional risk scoring

### 5. Emergency Admin Operations
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Low
**Description**: Add rate limit bypass for emergency admin operations.

**Use Cases**:
- Emergency fund recovery
- Critical security responses
- System maintenance operations

## Monitoring and Analytics

### 6. Security Event Monitoring
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Description**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for security events.

**Features**:
- Real-time alerts for suspicious activity
- Dashboard for security metrics
- Integration with external monitoring services
- Automated incident response

### 7. Transaction Pattern Analysis
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: High
**Description**: Implement advanced transaction pattern analysis for better fraud detection.

**Features**:
- Behavioral biometrics
- Spending pattern analysis
- Peer group comparison
- Seasonal pattern detection

## Operational Improvements

### 8. Audit Log Persistence
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Description**: Implement long-term audit log storage with efficient querying.

**Features**:
- Export to external storage (R2, S3)
- Indexed search capabilities
- Compliance reporting
- Data retention policies

### 9. Batch Transaction Processing
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Medium
**Description**: Implement batching for high-volume scenarios to improve performance.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced database writes
- Better throughput for bulk operations
- Lower latency for grouped transactions

## Development Experience

### 10. Security Testing Framework
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Description**: Create comprehensive security testing utilities.

**Features**:
- Automated penetration testing
- Fuzzing for edge cases
- Load testing for rate limits
- Security regression tests
