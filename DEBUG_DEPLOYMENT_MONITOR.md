# 🔍 Debug Deployment Monitor

## Status: Comprehensive Error Logging Deployed

**Time:** ~5 minutes ago  
**Deploy Status:** ✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub  
**CI/CD:** Currently building and deploying

## What Was Added

### 📊 Comprehensive Logging Added To:

1. **API Layer** (`/packages/api/src/routes.ts`)
   - ✅ Request parsing with timestamps
   - ✅ User authentication status
   - ✅ Body parsing with full payload dump
   - ✅ Config validation with detailed errors
   - ✅ Durable Object creation flow
   - ✅ Request/response debugging
   - ✅ Complete error stack traces

2. **Durable Object** (`/packages/persistence/src/game-table-do.ts`)
   - ✅ handleCreateTable entry with timestamps
   - ✅ Request headers and body logging
   - ✅ State update progress tracking
   - ✅ Storage serialization debugging
   - ✅ saveState() detailed flow logging
   - ✅ Complete error capture with context

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Deployment (≈ 5-10 minutes)
The deployment is currently in progress. Once complete:

### 2. Test Table Creation
Try creating a table again. The logs will now show:
- ✅ Exactly where the process fails
- ✅ Complete error messages and stack traces  
- ✅ State of all variables at failure point
- ✅ Whether it's API level or Durable Object level

### 3. Monitor Logs
I can help you check the Cloudflare logs to see the detailed error output:

```bash
# Command to tail logs when ready
npx wrangler tail primo-poker-server --format pretty
```

### 4. Immediate Diagnosis
Once you test table creation, the logs will tell us:
- **API Issues:** Authentication, validation, routing problems
- **Durable Object Issues:** State management, storage, serialization
- **Communication Issues:** Problems between API and Durable Object
- **Data Issues:** Malformed requests, validation failures

### Expected Log Output

When you create a table, you should see logs like:
```
🚀 API - handleCreateTable called at 2025-08-04T...
👤 User authenticated: {"userId":"...", "username":"..."}
✅ GAME_TABLES namespace available
📖 Parsing request body...
✅ Body parsed successfully: {...}
🔧 Creating table config...
🚀 GameTableDO - handleCreateTable called at 2025-08-04T...
💾 saveState() - Starting state serialization...
```

**If any step fails, we'll see exactly where and why.**

## Test When Ready

Once the CI/CD pipeline completes (you can check at https://github.com/AlabamaMike/primoPokerServerlessCF/actions), please:

1. **Try creating a table**
2. **Note the exact error message**  
3. **Let me know** - I can then check the logs to pinpoint the issue

The comprehensive logging will give us a complete picture of what's breaking in the table creation flow.
