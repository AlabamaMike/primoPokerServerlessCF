# Desktop Client Test Results

## Summary
The Primo Poker desktop client has been successfully built with core functionality implemented and tested. Here's what's working:

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Project Structure**
   - Tauri-based desktop application with Rust backend
   - React TypeScript frontend with Vite
   - Secure authentication with OS keyring integration
   - E2E testing with Playwright

2. **Authentication System**
   - Login form with email/password
   - Secure token storage using OS keyring (not browser storage)
   - Logout functionality
   - Persistent authentication across app restarts
   - Integration with backend JWT system

3. **Lobby Functionality**
   - Table listing with real-time updates (5-second refresh)
   - Create table with custom configuration
   - Join table functionality
   - Player count indicators
   - Game phase and pot display
   - Navigation between main menu and lobby

4. **Connection Management**
   - Backend health checking with latency measurement
   - Connection status display
   - Retry mechanism for failed connections
   - Configurable backend URL via environment variables

### 🧪 Test Results

**Core UI Tests (4/5 passed):**
- ✅ App renders with title
- ✅ Shows connection status element
- ✅ UI components render correctly
- ❌ Authentication components exist (fails when backend unreachable)
- ✅ Lobby navigation flow

**App Launch Tests (2/3 passed):**
- ✅ Desktop app launches and connects to backend
- ✅ Shows connection status with latency
- ❌ Retry connection button state management

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Frontend Technologies:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Tauri API for native integration

**Backend Technologies:**
- Rust with Tauri framework
- Reqwest for HTTP client
- Keyring crate for secure storage
- Serde for JSON serialization

**Security Features:**
- Tokens stored in OS keyring (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- No sensitive data in browser storage
- Secure communication with backend API

### 📝 Known Issues

1. **Backend Dependency**: The app requires the backend to be running for full functionality
2. **Retry Button**: Connection retry doesn't show "Connecting..." state properly
3. **Test Environment**: Some tests fail when backend is unreachable

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Port Game Table UI**: Implement the actual poker game interface
2. **WebSocket Integration**: Add real-time game updates
3. **Offline Mode**: Allow practice games without backend connection
4. **Auto-updater**: Implement automatic updates for the desktop client
5. **Installer**: Create platform-specific installers

### 💻 Running the Desktop Client

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test:e2e

# Start Vite dev server only
npm run dev:vite
```

### 🔗 Backend Configuration

The client connects to the production backend by default:
- URL: https://primo-poker-server.alabamamike.workers.dev

To use a local backend:
1. Create `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Set: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787`

## Conclusion

The desktop client foundation is solid with authentication and lobby features fully implemented. The architecture supports secure token storage and provides a good base for adding the game UI and WebSocket functionality. The test coverage demonstrates that core features are working correctly when the backend is available.
